### 3.1 classification

#### BBBP
The Blood–brain barrier penetration (BBBP) dataset comes from a recent study (PMID: 22612593) 
on the modeling and prediction of the barrier permeability. As a membrane separating circulating blood 
and brain extracellular fluid, the blood–brain barrier blocks most drugs, hormones and neurotransmitters. 
Thus penetration of the barrier forms a long-standing issue in development of drugs targeting central 
nervous system. This dataset includes over 2,000 compounds on their permeability properties

load the dataset as follow:
```
deepchem.molnet.load_bbbp(featurizer: Union[deepchem.feat.base_classes.Featurizer, str] = 'ECFP', splitter:

Optional[Union[deepchem.splits.splitters.Splitter, str]] = 'scaffold', transformers:

List[Union[deepchem.molnet.load_function.molnet_loader.TransformerGenerator, str]] =

['balancing'], reload: bool = True, data_dir: Optional[str] = None, save_dir: Optional[

str] = None, **kwargs) → Tuple[List[str], Tuple[deepchem.data.datasets.Dataset,

. . . ], List[transformers.Transformer]]

"Name" – compound name

"Smiles" – SMILES representation of molecular structure

"P_np" – binary representation of permeability/non permeability

#### Tox21
The “Toxicology in the 21st Century” (Tox21) initiative created a public database measuring toxicity 
of compounds, which has been used in the 2014 Tox21 Data Challenge (http://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/challenge/).

#### ClinTox
The ClinTox dataset, introduced as part of this work, compares drugs approved 
by the FDA and drugs that have failed clinical trials for toxicity reasons (PMID: 27642066). 
The dataset includes two classification tasks for 1,491 drug compounds with known chemical structures: 
(1) clinical trial toxicity (or absence of toxicity) and (2) FDA approval status. List of FDA-approved 
drugs are compiled from the SWEETLEAD database (PMID: 24223973), and list of drugs that failed clinical 
trials for toxicity reasons are compiled from the Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT) 
database (http://www.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/aact-database).

#### HIV
The HIV dataset was introduced by the Drug Therapeutics Program (DTP) 
AIDS Antiviral Screen, which tested the ability to inhibit HIV replication for 
over 40,000 compounds (http://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/NCIDTPdata/AIDS+Antiviral+Screen+Data). 
Screening results were evaluated and placed into three categories: confirmed inactive (CI), 
confirmed active (CA) and confirmed moderately active (CM). We further combine the latter two labels, 
making it a classification task between inactive (CI) and active (CA and CM).

load the dataset as follow:
```

['balancing'], reload: bool = True, data_dir: Optional[str] = None, save_dir: Optional[

str] = None, **kwargs) → Tuple[List[str], Tuple[deepchem.data.datasets.Dataset,

. . . ], List[transformers.Transformer]]
```

The meaning of the columns in the original document includes the following:

"Smiles": SMILES representation of molecular structure

"Activity": three types of labels for filtering results: CI/CM/CA

"HIV_active": binary label of filter result: 1 (CA/CM) and 0 (CI)
